# ABOT

ABOT is a very simple discord bot I made to use the MIT HAN Lab's TinyChatEngine in Discord. It consists of two parts, a python file using discord.py and a shell wrapper for the TinyChatEngine. I use screen to run both of them, but feel free to do whatever to keep them running in the background.

# REQUIREMENTS

Install TinyChatEngine from (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/TinyChatEngine)

Install discord.py and pwntools for python

Add your discord token to a new discord\_token file
